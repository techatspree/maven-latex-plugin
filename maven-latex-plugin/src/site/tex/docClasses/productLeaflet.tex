\title{Leaflet of the \texttt{latex-maven-plugin}}
\author{E. Reissner}
\date{\today{} ernst.reissner@simuline.eu}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

The purpose of this leaflet is twofold:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Give an overview over the plugin. 
  But: 
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The single official description of the plugin is the manual~\cite{LatexPlugin}.
    \item The 
    \href{http://simuline.eu/LatexMavenPlugin/index.html}{project site} 
    gives already an overview. 
    \item 
    The content of this leaflet~\cite{LeafLeaf} is updated only by need. 
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Demonstrate that the plugin can compile a leaflet using the \texttt{leaflet} document class. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}

\subsection{Realized Features}

Automatically creates documents from LaTeX sources during the Maven \texttt{site} phase 
and in an ant run. 

This comprises running basic tools like \texttt{lualatex} and \texttt{bibtex} 
and rerunning them by need. 

\subsubsection{Input and output}

Supports 
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  many output formats like PDF, DVI, HTML, DOCX, RTF, TXT and others
  \item
  many graphical input formats like PNG, MP, FIG, gnuplot; 
  also provides a separate goal creating them, \texttt{grp} 
  \item
  bibliography, index, glossary and embedded code; in particular split index
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Checks}

Checks 
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  sources with \texttt{chktex} and logs the results in target and goal \texttt{chk} 
  \item
  versions of used tools via goal \texttt{vrs} 
  \item
  log files detecting errors and warnings 
  \item
  whether a document could have been reproduced, by demand 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Orchestration and document development}

Orchestration of various tools detecting need for execution e.g.
of \texttt{bibtex} including \texttt{rerunfilecheck} for \texttt{lualatex} and friends.

Supports document development, mainly by cooperating with editor, viewer and with other tools in the build chain. 
Offers 
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item various scripts, 
  most notably an installation script for extensions of VS Code.
  \item configuration file \texttt{.chktexrc} for \texttt{chktex}.
  \item Oconfiguration file \texttt{.latexmkrc} 
  for \texttt{latexmk} synchronized with the configuration.
  \item header files like \texttt{header.tex} 
  to unify packages loaded by latex main files.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Planned Features}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Support \texttt{biber} replacing \texttt{bibtex} as preferred tool
  \item Support \texttt{xindy} replacing \texttt{makeindex} as preferred tool
  \item Support \texttt{bib2gls} replacing \texttt{makeglossary} as preferred tool
  \item Execute \texttt{glosstex} if needed
  \item Usage of the \texttt{multibib} macros
  \item \dots
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Goals}

  An overview is on the 
  \href{http://simuline.eu/LatexMavenPlugin/plugin-info.html}{goals page}. 
  

  Besides goals referring to creating output of a given type 
  like \texttt{pdf}, \texttt{odt} and \texttt{html}, 
  there is a goal \texttt{cfg}, 
  which allows configuring various output formats as \texttt{targets}. % chktex 1
  
  One further goal, \texttt{chk} to perform a check with \texttt{chktex} 
  is allowed among the \texttt{targets}. 

  The other goals cannot serve as targets: 
  %
  \begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{vrs}] to check versions of tools, 
    \item[\texttt{grp}] to create graphic files speeding up use of \texttt{latexmk} 
    and 
    \item[\texttt{inj}] to inject useful files like headers or config files 
    like \texttt{.latexmkrc}. 
  \end{description}

  \newpage

  \section{Examples}

  As this is the main usage of this software, 
  usage refers to usage as a maven plugin. 
  Since it did not yet make it into the repository maven central, 
  it can be accessed only giving the source repository explicitly: 

  \begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
    <project>
      ...
      <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>publicRepoAtSimuline</id>
        <name>repo at simuline</name>
        <url>https://www.simuline.eu/RepositoryMaven</url>
      </repository>
      ...
    </project>
  \end{Verbatim}

  Also, it must be ensured that the plugin is executed 
  when building the application and when building the according site. 
  This is a side effect of configuring the \texttt{maven-jxr-plugin}. 

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
<project>
  ...
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jxr-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.0</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
</project>
\end{Verbatim}

  Given this, usage can be as simple as setting 


  
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>eu.simuline.m2latex</groupId>
        <artifactId>latex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <phase>site</phase>
            <goals><goal>pdf</goal></goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
\end{Verbatim}


But fully configuring all executions, 
e.g. including version checks and injections 
e.g. of headers looks like this. 


\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
<project>
  ...
  <plugin>
    <groupId>eu.simuline.m2latex</groupId>
    <artifactId>latex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <configuration>
      <settings>
        <!--targets>chk, pdf, html</targets-->
        <!--cleanUp>false</cleanUp-->
        ...
      </settings>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>process-latex-sources</id>
        <!-- chk, dvi, pdf, html, odt, docx, rtf, txt -->
        <goals><goal>cfg</goal></goals>
        <!-- phase>site</phase-->
      </execution>
      <execution>
        <id>clear-latex-sources</id>
        <goals><goal>clr</goal></goals>
        <!-- phase>clean</phase-->
      </execution>
      <execution>
        <?m2e execute onConfiguration?>
        <id>inject-files</id>
        <goals><goal>inj</goal></goals>
        <!-- phase>validate</phase-->
        <configuration>
          <injections>latexmkrc,chktexrc,header</injections>
        </configuration>
      </execution>
      <execution>
        <id>validate-converters</id>
        <goals><goal>vrs</goal></goals>
        <!-- phase>validate</phase-->
        <configuration>
          <versionsWarnOnly>true</versionsWarnOnly>
        </configuration>
      </execution>
    </executions>
  </plugin>
  ...
</project>
\end{Verbatim}

Note that even in this complex example, 
further configuration is only sketched, 
which is justified because 
there is in general little deviation from the default 
to be mentioned explicitly. 
So, more complex examples are rare. 

For a full description of configuration, 
see the manual~\cite{LatexPlugin}, Chapter 6.
