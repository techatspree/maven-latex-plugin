    <!-- Release plan: 
	 For 1.7: 
	 - further output formats: xml from latexml, epub. 
	   in manual: flow oriented vs page oriented. 
	   Flow oriented: html, ... epub, ... 
	   Page oriented: pdf, latex (dvi), office (odt, xdoc, ...)
	   Take multipubguide.pdf into account.
	 - Further exporters with config to access them 
	   besides latex2ht also latexml, pandoc 
	   Have a look at texnische komoedie, pdf checked in. 
	 For 1.6:
	 - make capabilities inspired by latexmk: 
	   If latex is invoked with option -recorder it creates a file .fls
	   containing all the files read during its run. 
	   If this software runs latex, after that it looks for an .fls file 
	   and if found stores an .lmk file 
	   containing hashs for the files mentioned in .fls. 
	   These hashs indicate potential changes. 
	   As a first step we may use modification time. 
	   In the next run, before invoking latex, 
	   this software checks whether the .lmk file is present. 
	   If not, latex is invoked. 
	   If it is present, then it is invoked only 
	   if files is modified, including the source. 
	   We need a mechanism to know whether invoked as a maven plugin, 
	   ant task or standalone. 
	   The latter stores command line file reflecting command line options. 
	   Then also the config, e.g. pom.xml, build.xml or command line file 
	   is taken into account to detect changes. 
	   Hm, no. If something changes in pom, that is no indication. 
	   There must be a file, maybe in ~/.lmk, 
	   reflecting the options of the last run. 
	 For 1.5: 
	 - meta info for this software including own version 
	   git interface 
	 - awareness of version of converters, both expected and actual 
	   Add also according testcases 
	 - this software offered also as a standalone application 
	   and as an api to integrate everywhere. 
	 - also for documentation, meta information 
	   like version but also author email and so on are vital. 
	   To that end, either git checkout script is needed 
	   or maybe latex git package. 
	   Note that there may be documentation not created through latex 
	   and so git package may not be a generic solution. 
	 - For tests we need a valid pdf.
	   So for tests a pdf without version information and without date
	   and without git info must be created.
	 - include docs in jar.
	 - redesign: Target s are creational ones.
	   In mojos we also have creational ones and others.
	   The method AbstractLatexMojo.getTargetSet()
           is appropriate for creational targets only.
	   Maybe rename Target-{}->CreationalTarget,
	   and redesign: CreationalMojo.getTargetSet().
	 - There must be a mojo for phase validate or initialize
	   checking the most important things:
	   - Whether the converters mentioned are registered.
	     This refers to the commands to run and to the excluded converters.

       this shall be included in the jar.

	    What is needed is an evaluation of the formats: 
	    docbook, apt, xdoc, markdown. 
	    Partially apt seems superior to markdown. 
	    On the other hand, unification is necessary. 
	    Also important: does the site plugin support markdown? -->
       <!-- TBD: complete rework for ant users: 
	    starting from how to google and how to find sites. 
	    Are all references present? 
	    Does the software work properly? -->
       <!-- TBD: add this plugin to mavencentral

       <!-- TBD: vrs may be tied to lifecycle phase

	    then one has to ensure that only the configured are used. -->
       <!-- TBD: fill in the gap given by tool makeindex: 
	    does not allow to get its version without breaking it 
	    or applying it on a file. 
	    Maybe the solution is to replace it by upmendex -->
       <!-- TBD: goal latex:vrs 
	    shall work even if not all converters are installed.

       This eases development of latex files considerably
       because one can invoke the needed tools directly
       without using this plugin/task.
       Also one can use forward/backward search between editor and viewer.
