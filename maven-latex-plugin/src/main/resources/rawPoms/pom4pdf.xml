the declaration '\documentclass' 
or the old fashioned 'documentstyle' 
preceeded by a few constucts. 
Strictly speaking, this is not necessary. 
For a more thorough discussion,  
and for an alternative approach, consult the manual. 

The default value is choosen to match quite exactly 
the latex main files, no more no less. 
Since the pattern is chosen 
according to documentation collected from the internet, 
one can never be sure whether the pattern is perfect.

            <!-- This pattern is applied to file names 
and matching shall accept all the files 
which were created from a latex main file 'xxx.tex'. 
It is neither applied to directories 
nor to 'xxx.tex' itself. 
It shall not comprise neither graphic files to be processed 
nor files created from those graphic files. 

This pattern is applied 
in the course of processing graphic files 
to decide which graphic files should be processed 
(those rejected by this pattern) 
and to log warnings if there is a risk, 
that graphic files to be processed 
are skipped or that processing a latex main file overwrites 
the result of graphic preprocessing. 

When clearing the tex source directory $texSrcProcDirectory, 
i.e. all generated files should be removed, 
first those created from latex main files. 
As an approximation, 
those are removed which match this pattern. 

The sequence 'T$T' 
is replaced by the prefix 'xxx'. 
The sequence 'T$T' must always be replaced: 
The symbol '$' occurs as end-sign as ')$' 
or as literal symbol as '\$'. 
Thus 'T$T' is no regular occurrence 
and must always be replaced with 'xxx'. 

Spaces and newlines are removed 
from that pattern before matching. 

This pattern may never be ensured to be complete, 
because any package 
may create files with names matching its own patterns 
and so any new package may break completeness. 

If the current default value is not appropriate, 
please overwrite it in the configuration

This uses always the dvi-format. 
What is also affected are the tasks

the files to be copied to $targetSiteDirectory,

            <!-- The options of the command $chkTexCommand, 
except '-o output-file' 
specifying the output file which is added automatically. 

Here is a list of options useful in this context. 
The first group of these are muting options: 
- '-w', '-e', '-m', 
Make the message number passed as parameter 
a warning/an error/a message and turns it on. 
Messages are not counted. 
- '-n'
Turns the warning/error number passed as a parameter off. 
- '-L'
Turns off suppression of messages on a per line basis. 

The next group of interesting options are for output control: 
- '-q'
Shuts up about copyright information.
- '-o output-file'
Specifies the output file. This is added automatically 
and shall thus not be specified by the user. 
- '-b[0|1]'
If you use the -o switch, and the named outputfile exists,
it will be renamed to 'filename.bak'.
- '-f format'
Specifies the format of the output 
via a format similar to 'printf()'. 
For details consult the manual. 
- '-vd'
Verbosity level followed by a number 'd' 
specifying the format of the output. 
The verbosity number is resolved as a pattern 
as if given by the option '-f format'. 
Thus the option '-v' is ignored 
if the option '-f format' is specified. 

The default value is '-q -b0' 
avoiding verbose output and backing up the output log-file. -->

      Then a strict diff command like 'diff' is appropriate. 
      Else another diff command is required which checks for a kind of visual equality. 
      The default value is a mere 'diff'.
