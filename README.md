# The latex-maven-plugin and ant task 

Use this maven-latex-plugin in your Maven projects 
and this ant tasks in your ant projects 
to automatically convert 
all LaTeX documents `*.tex` into the desired output format. 

The maven plugin and the ant task, 
both pieces of software share the same code base, 
called the '**LaTeX builder**', 
and provides its (common) features.
Whereas the features implemented are outlined in the sequel 
in [Section 'Features'](#ss:features) 
the features to come are collected in 
[Section 'Feature Requests'](#ss:featureRequests).

Also note that the full manual of this software is written in LaTeX 
and can be generated by the maven plugin and by the ant task it refers to. 
The manual itself provides any details a user may wish. 
Download the latest version under 
[manualLatexMavenPlugin.pdf](https://www.simuline.eu/LatexMavenPlugin/manualLatexMavenPlugin.pdf).
<!-- TBD: this will be created also as html and deployed to the website 
and then linked also from this pla. -->

For pieces of information on installation and usage 
specific for the maven plugin or for the ant tasks, 
we refer to ['The latex-maven-plugin' Section](#ss:mavenPlugin)
and to ['The latex ant tasks' Section](#ss:antTasks), respectively. 
In addition, the [pom file](./maven-latex-plugin/pom.xml) 
and the [build file](./maven-latex-plugin/build.xml) 
illustrate installation and usage. 

The improvements the author plans 
are collected as ['TO-DOs'](#ss:todo) without special ordering.

Section [Features](#ss:features) describes the features of the converter 
independently of context of maven or ant. 
As the '**LaTeX builder**' is merely a bundle of converters 
to offer an interface to maven and to ant, 
it relies on several converters doing the proper work, 
as e.g. `pdflatex` to convert latex into PDF format. 
Section [Installation](#ss:installation)
is about installation of these converters. 

## Features <a id='ss:features'></a>

The main use of the '**LaTeX builder**' is to automatically convert 
all LaTeX documents `.tex` 
which are by default in `$root/src/tex/` and subdirectories 
into desired output format(s) and to push 
to the targets' folder by default to `$root/target/site/`. 
To that end, it applies a latex converter like `pdflatex` 
to the top level sources ignoring `.tex` files which are just included. 

### Output in various formats <!--{#sss:featuresOutFormats}--><a id='sss:featuresOutFormats'></a>

One aim is to convert latex files in printable formats 
like `pdf`, formats in the office world like `docx` and browser formats 
like `html`. 
The following lists the supported output formats 
together with the converters used by this plugin. 
The author must admit that there is a lot to do still, 
to provide good conversions in formats other than 
`pdf`, `dvi` and `ps` and `txt`. 

- `pdf`, `dvi`, `ps` (with converters `pdflatex`, `xelatex` or similar.)
- `html`, `xhtml` (partially supported). 
  The author is not content with `htlatex` for many reasons. 
  It is in the package `texlive-tex4th`.
- `docx`, `rtf`, `odt` (TBC)
- `txt` 
- ... 
- `log` file with the result of style check `chktex` for latex sources. 

For further plans see [here](#ss:featureRequests). 

### Support for development of sources <a id='sss:featuresDevSrc'></a>

The '**LaTeX builder**' is designed 
to build artifacts for all source documents at once 
searching in a specified folder for the `tex`-files and related 
as bib-files and graphic files. 

This is appropriate for deployment 
but not when changing and developing a single document. 
For that scenario, it is better to use an editor and viewer, 
maybe a build tool like `latexmk` 
synchronized and compile single files 
with the various tools within the enclosing working directory. 

To make the '**LaTeX builder**' compatible with development, 
it has to create intermediate files and output files like `pdf` 
in the working directory. 
Intermediate files are needed for parts which need sorting 
like bibliographies or indices but also for most kind of graphics 
to be included into a LaTeX document. 

The '**LaTeX builder**' can use these intermediate files 
as it creates these files also in the working directory 
and can also perform a cleanup 
needed in a build process as described in 
[Section 'Cleanup after creation'](#sss:featuresCleanup). 

When starting development of a document with a lot of graphics 
from a clean working directory 
it is quite cumbersome to create intermediate graphic files 
includable in `.tex` files. 

Thus, '**LaTeX builder**' offers separate creation of these graphic files 
through the maven goal `grp`. 

### Cleanup after creation <a id='sss:featuresCleanup'></a>

Of course, besides creation there is also a way to clean up, 
i.e. to remove files built. 
Whereas files in the target directory are removed by the build process 
both of maven and of ant, 
there is a maven goal and an ant task to remove the intermediate files 
in the working directory which is the directory of the source documents. 
For details see 
[Section 'Support for development of sources'](#sss:featuresDevSrc). 

### Reproducibility and equality artifacts <a id='sss:repArts'></a>

There are use cases, where one wants to check correctness of artifacts. 
Thus, a kind of reproducibility is needed. 
In particular when creating `pdf` files, this is nontrivial, 
because even if the source files don't change, 
the resulting `pdf`s differ in general for each run. 
The reason is that by default, latex includes a lot of meta-data which changes. 
Above all this is time and date stamp 
but also the so-called banner. 

In the [manual](https://www.simuline.eu/LatexMavenPlugin/manualLatexMavenPlugin.pdf), 
we show how to write latex sources in a way that the artifacts are reproducible. 
In addition, we present a weaker concept of equality, 
namely visual equality 
which allows checking reproducibility if equality is not reachable. 

The subject reproducibility is particularly vital 
because the manual of the '**LaTeX builder**' 
is created with '**LaTeX builder**'. 
This document is also used to test correctness in a regression test. 
Another aspect of reproducibility is, when computations are performed the results of which are incorporated in the artifact. 
This is not treated here 
but in an item of [Section 'Feature Request'](#ss:featureRequests). 

### Inclusion of bibliographies, indices and similar content <a id='sss:featuresLists'></a>

Also, this '**LaTeX builder**' supports bibliographies, 
indices (also split ones) and glossaries. 
Support of table of contents, 
list of figures, list of tables and list of listings 
refers to clean up only. 
There is an according ant task and a maven goal. 

### Check of sources and results, logging <a id='sss:featuresCheckLog'></a>

Analyzing the log file created by the converters, 
the '**LaTeX builder**' displays errors and warnings, e.g. overfull boxes. 
Also based on the log file, it reruns the latex converter by need. 
So the aim is
that **if compilation is without error or warning, the output is valid and perfect.**

Another aspect is check of sources which is available 
through the maven goal `chk`. 

### Input of various graphics formats <a id='sss:featuresInputGrp'></a>

The last feature to point out is the support for various graphic formats 
including those provided by the package `texlive-graphix`. 
The following graphic formats are supported: 

- `tikz`/`pgf` is included by the `tex` converter 
  and needs no action from the **LaTeX builder**. 
  Note that `tikzedt` is a good graphical editor for that. 
- metapost, `.mp` is a native format 
  in used in the context of the `tex` format
- `jpg`, `png` and by need other pixel formats are via package `graphix` 
- gnuplot, `.gp` and SVG are converted into a `tex` file 
  containing text and `pdf`/`eps` with the pure graphics. 
- `xfig`, an old format which is somehow deprecated 
  and can be replaced by `tikz`/`pgf`. 
  A graphical editor is `xfig`. 
  
Note that there is a maven goal `grp` to create the graphics files only. 

### Version checks <a id='sss:featureVersionChk'></a>

A way to determine the current version of the **LaTeX builder** 
and of the converters used versus the versions expected. 
This may give hints on if something went wrong, 
in particular with graphics. 

This feature is available not for the ant task 
but for the maven plugin through the goal `vrs`. 
So versions can be checked via command line by 

```bash
mvn latex:vrs
```

In the lifecycle, this is performed in phase `validate`. 

## Feature Requests <a id='ss:featureRequests'></a>

Beyond the features presented in [Section 'Features'](#ss:features), 
further features are planned for future releases: 

- Currently, this software consists of the core component **LaTeX builder**, 
  a maven plugin and an ant task. 
  It would be desirable to access the **LaTeX builder** 
  through an API, also to be described in the manual 
  and to provide it also as a standalone application as `latexmk`. 
- Currently, a build is a complete build 
  also if only some artifacts are out of date. 
  A differential build is desirable 
  as done by `latexmk`. 
- Initially, it was the aim to generate output in "all usual output formats". 
  Due to several problems with package tex4ht, 
  this aim was not reached. 
  Also, the aim is not defined precisely enough. 
  The new suggestion is that the **LaTeX builder** shall generate output 
  of the following categories: 
  - page oriented formats, 
    - from World of TeX (`dvi`) 
    - from office universe 
      - MS-word (`docx`, `rtf`), 
      - open office `odt` and maybe others; see 
        [`OpenDocument`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument)
    - cross-platform (`pdf`, `ps`)
  - floating formats comprising internet formats (`html`, `xhtml`, `md`, ...) 
    and e-book formats (at least `epub`) 
  - Intermediate format written by `latexml` 
    which serves as a way to analyze a LaTeX source 
    without need to parse in its odd grammar. 
  - Plain text, e.g. for text analysis 
- Currently, one can specify output formats uniform for all LaTeX documents. 
  It may be desirable to be able to specify the output format 
  for any document specifically overriding the general specification. 
- One may give `biblatex` a trial replacing `bibtex` as the default. 
  Also, more conservatively, use `bibtexu` or `bibtex8` instead of `bibtex`. 
- `pythontex` is a great tool to perform computations 
  in python and also other programming languages like `matlab` 
  and to include the results in a latex file. 
  This shall be supported in future releases. 

## Installation <a id='ss:installation'></a>

Of course, to run the maven plugin one does need `maven` 
and accordingly for the ant task one needs `ant`. 
The details of integration in maven and ant 
are given in Sections [The latex-maven-plugin](#ss:mavenPlugin) 
and [The latex ant tasks](#ss:antTasks) and their subsections. 

| Executable   | package          |
|:-------------|:-----------------|
| `mvn`        | maven, maven-lib |
| `ant`        | ant              |

This section is more about the converters used by the '**LaTeX builder**'. 
We provide the executables and the packages with versions tested. 
The default values are emphasized. 
Note that this software is designed only to run with the executables 
with the versions given in 
[VERSIONS](./maven-latex-plugin/src/main/resources/version.properties). 
As you can see, the versions must be within an interval. 

At first, converting LaTeX into `pdf` format choose one of the 
applications mentioned in the next table 

| executable     | package                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| **`pdflatex`** | `texlive-latex-bin-bin` |
|   `lualatex`   | `texlive-latex-bin-bin` |
|   `xelatex`    | `texlive-xetex-bin`     |

Besides `pdf`, also other output formats are supported. 
The aim is to create formats from the world of 

- printable docs like `pdf`, 
- internet like `html`, 
- Microsoft and open office like `docx` and `odt`, 
- simple text (`txt`-format) 

In addition, provide check of sources via `chktex`. 

Currently, creation of output in format other than `pdf`, 
is not very mature. 
Thus, the following table lists in brackets also software which is not in use 
but worth to be evaluated. 
The following converters are used for the various *output* formats. 

| Format   | executable                 | package                |
|:---------|----------------------------|:-----------------------|
| `html`   | **`htlatex`,...**          | `tex2live-tex4ht`      |
| `rtf`    | **`latex2rtf`**            |         `latex2rtf`    |
| `png`    |  (`latex2png`)             |         `latex2rtf`    |
| `html`   |  (l`atex2html`)            |         `latex2html`   |
| `man`    |  (`latex2man`)             | `texlive-latex2man`    |
| `braile` |  (`latex2nemeth`)          | `texlive-latex2nemeth` |
| `*`      | **`odt2doc`**, (`unoconv`) | `unoconv`              |
| `*`      | **(`pandoc`)**             | `pandoc`               |
| `txt`    | **`pdftotext`**            | `poppler-tools`        |
| `html`   |   (`pdftohtml`)            | `poppler-tools`        |
| `ps`     |   (`pdftops`)              | `poppler-tools`        |
| `*`      |   (`pdftocairo`)           | `poppler-tools`        |
| `ps`     |    `dvips`                 | `texlive-dvips-bin`    |
| `pdf`    |    `dvipdfm`               | `texlive-dvipdfmx-bin` |
| `pdf`    |  **`dvipdfmx`**          | `texlive-dvipdfmx-bin` |
| `pdf`    |   `xdvipdfmx`              | `texlive-dvipdfmx-bin` |
| `pdf`    |    `dvipdft`               | `texlive-dvipdfmx-bin` |
| `pdf`    |   (`dvipdf`)               | `ghostscript`          |
| `ps`     |   (`pdf2ps`)               | `ghostscript`          |
| `*`      |    `gs`                    | `ghostscript`          |
| ---      | **`chktex`**               | `texlive-chktex-bin`   |
| ---      | **`diff`**                 | `difftuils`            |
| ---      |   `diff-pdf`               | `diff-pdf`             |
| ---      |   `diff-pdf-visually`      | `diff-pdf-visually`*   |
| ---      |   `pdfinfo`                | `poppler-tools`        |
| ---      |   `exiftool`               | `exiftool`             |

The executable and package `diff-pdf-visually` is special 
in that it is a python package to be installed via 
`pip install diff-pdf-visually`. 

Some programs have no deliverable output (some write log files though):

- `chktex` just checks the style. 
- The diff-tools `diff`, `diff-pdf` and `diff-pdf-visually` 
  are not used to create difference output but return a flag only indicating whether two `pdf` files coincide. 
  We use this in the context of integration tests 
  to check that the `pdf` files created are 'visually equal' 
  to a checked version. 
- Accordingly, `pdfinfo` and `exiftool` 
  collect information on `pdf`-files and display them at standard output. 
  In the future, these are intended to check meta-info. 

For some software (output) format `*` is given. 
These programs are discussed below. 

Note that `dvips` and `gs` play a special role: 
even if not invoked directly as `ps`-format is not used, 
converter like `dvipdf` or `dvipdft` 
invoke them as a combination to create `ps` from `dvi` via `dvips` 
and then apply `gs` to obtain `pdf`.

The structure of `dvipdf` allows to reconstruct its version 
from that of `dvips` and of `gs`. 

To check style of latex sources use `chktex`. 
To convert to text, first convert to `pdf` and then to `pdf` 
via `pdftotext`. 

Currently, to create `hmtl`, 
`htlatex`, `htxelatex` and related are used to create. 
These come in package `texlife-tex4ht` which suffer several flaws. 
E.g. `CTAN` does not hold the definitive sources. 
Also, there is no real versioning. 
It depends on outdated `dvi` format, 
and does not work properly to convert the manual of this **LaTeX builder**. 

These are the reasons why the author would like to ban this altogether. 

Although not clearly documented, `unoconv` offers conversion 
from `html` to office formats (not yet used) 
and conversion between various office formats. 
In use is just `odt2doc`. 
Also in use is `latex2rtf` which provides a bad conversion from latex to `rtf` 
and insofar into the world of office formats. 

Pandoc seems to be the future since it can create quite good `html` 
and all office formats, maybe also text directly from latex. 

The program `gs` can convert `pdf` formats of various versions. 
This may be needed in future to include pictures into latex via `pdf`. 

To support bibliographies, traditionally a variant of `bibtex` is used. 

| Executable   | package                 |
|:-------------|:------------------------|
| **`bibtex`** | `texlive-latex-bin-bin` |
|   `bibtexu`  | `texlive-latex-bin-bin` |
|   `bibtex8`  | `texlive-xetex-bin`     |

Accordingly, traditionally `makeindex` creates indices; 
a newer alternative is `xindy`. 
If one needs split indices, use `splitindex` invoking `makeindex`. 

| Executable       | package                  |
|:---------------- |:------------------------ |
| **`makeindex`**  | `texlive-makeindex-bin`  |
| **`splitindex`** | `texlive-splitindex-bin` |
| `xindy`          | `xindy`                  |
| `upmendex`       | `texlive-uptex-bin`      |

Closely related to indices are glossaries created by `makeglossaries` 
which can use `makeindex` or `xindy`. 

| Executable           | package                      |
|:-------------------- |:-----------------------------|
| **`makeglossaries`** | `texlive-makeglossaries-bin` |

A way to include programmatically computed results, 
originally in python but in the meantime in other languages as well 
as e.g. `matlab` (accessible through the `matlab` clone `octave`) 
is offered by `pythontex`. 
It has two converters, `pythontex` and `depythontex`, 
which are spread over several packages. 

| Executable         | package                 |
|:------------------ |:------------------------|
| **`pythontex`**    | `texlive-pythontex-bin` |
|                    | `texlive-pythontex-doc` |
|                    | `texlive-pythontex`     |

More loosely coupled to the '**LaTeX builder**' 
is a build tool to build from individual sources, `latexmk`. 
Currently, it is not used by this software, and maybe it never will. 
On the other hand, there are reasons to support interaction with that tool 
in the course of [document development](#sss:featuresDevSrc). 
Of course there are alternatives to `latexmk`, 
but we decided to concentrate on a single tool, and we chose `latexmk`. 

| Executable    | package               |
|:------------- |:----------------------|
| **`latexmk`** | `texlive-latexmk-bin` |
|               | `texlive-latexmk-doc` |
|               | `texlive-latexmk`     |

Next we talk about the graphic formats which can be included into `tex` format. 

The following table shows a list of converters 
used for various graphic *input* formats 

| format          | executable         | package            |
|:----------------|--------------------|:-------------------|
| `tex`           | ---                | `texlive-pgf`      |
| `mp`            | **`mpost`**        | `texlive-metapost` |
| `jpg`,`png`,... | **`ebb`**          | `texlive-dvipdfmx` |
| `gp`            | **`gnuplot`**      | `gnuplot`          |
| `svg`           | **`inkscape`**     | `inkscape`         |
| `xfig`          | **`fig2dev`**      | `transfig`         |

The easiest to treat and still very strong graphic package is `tikz`/`pgf`. 
It is included within `tex` 
and although it creates intermediate `pdf`, 
this **LaTeX builder** has nothing to do to make it work. 

Almost as good is `metapost` (`mp`) which is supported natively, 
and the builder has only to run the converter. 
The formats `bb` and `xbb` specify bounding boxes 
and are to include `jpg` and `png`, also natively. 
So, in a sense, `ebb` is for these pixel formats. 
Gnuplot (`gp`) and Scalable Vector Graphics (`svg`) 
are external formats with converters creating `tex` for text 
and `pdf` or `eps` (encapsulated postscript) 
for the graphic part. 
Finally, `xfig` format is a bit deprecated. 
It is not worth it to include when we want to implement incremental build. 
The formats `tikz`/`pgf` provide a superset of the features of `xfig`. 

## How to use the latex-maven-plugin <a id='ss:mavenPlugin'></a>

Goals `cfg` to create, `clr` to clean up as described 
in [Section 'Cleanup after creation'](#sss:featuresCleanup). 
Invocation is e.g. as `mvn latex:cfg`. 

These goals are in a one-to-one relation 
to an according ant task 
described in [Section 'How to use the latex ant tasks'](#ss:antTasks).

The other goals of the maven plugin go beyond ant functionality. 

- There are separate goals to create artifacts in a specific format
  `pdf`, `dvi`, `docx`, `rtf`, `odt`, `html` and `txt`. 
- Goal `chk` for a style check on the sources. 
  This is advisable at the end of development but also 
  as sporadic intermediate step. 
- There is another goal, `grp`, to build the graphic files only. 
  This is used mainly during development of the documents: 
  If all graphics is present, one can go on with an IDE 
  without this plugin. 
- Goal `vrs` checks the versions of the converters. 

A maven plugin is just an interface between maven 
and the application(s) doing all the work. 
We refer the reader to [Section 'Installation'](#ss:installation) 
for preparatory installations. 

Unfortunately, this plugin did not yet make it into maven central. 
Thus, one has to add the providers' repository to the pom: 

```xml
<project ...>
  ...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>publicRepoAtSimuline</id>
      <name>repo at simuline</name>
      <url>https://www.simuline.eu/public_html/RepositoryMaven</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
  ...
</project>
```

Then it can be used from command line,
e.g. to create `pdf`s as `mvn latex:pdf`
or for cleanup `mvn latex:clr` with default configuration:

```xml
<project ...>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>eu.simuline.m2latex</groupId>
        <artifactId>latex-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.5-SNAPSHOT</version> 
      </plugin>
      ...
   </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
```

To make the plugin available within a build,
one has to add executions, e.g. as listed below.
The execution 

- `process-latex-sources` is to process latex sources as with `mvn latex:cfg`,
- `clear-latex-sources` is to clean input folders from created files
  as with `mvn latex:clr`
- `validate-converters` is recommended to ensure
  that the converters used by the plugin are checked for their versions
  as with `mvn latex:vrs`.

Note that, in order to install the plugin from the sources
for development of the plugin itself,
the executions must be deactivated, because the plugin is invoked
in several phases of the build. 

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>|\groupId|</groupId>
  <artifactId>|\artifactId|</artifactId>
  <version>|\versionID|</version>
  <configuration>
  ...
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <id>process-latex-sources</id>
      <!-- grp, dvi, pdf, html, rtf, odt, docx, txt, chk -->
      <goals><goal>cfg</goal></goals>
    </execution>

		 It shall not comprise neither graphic files to be processed 
		 nor files created from those graphic files. 
		 
		 This pattern is applied 
		 in the course of processing graphic files 
		 to decide which graphic files should be processed 
		 (those rejected by this pattern) 
		 and to log warnings if there is a risk, 
		 that graphic files to be processed 
		 are skipped or that processing a latex main file overwrites 
		 the result of graphic preprocessing. 
		 
		 When clearing the tex source directory $texSrcProcDirectory,

		 As an approximation, 
		 those are removed which match this pattern. 
		 
		 The sequence 'T$T'

		 The sequence 'T$T' must always be replaced:

		 Thus 'T$T' is no regular occurrence

		 Spaces and newlines are removed 
		 from that pattern before matching. 
		 
		 This pattern may never be ensured to be complete,

## How to use the latex ant tasks <a name='ss:antTasks'>

This software provides two ant tasks: one for creation of artifacts 
and another one to clean them up. 
Note that the according maven plugin 
described in [Section 'The latex-maven-plugin'](#ss:mavenPlugin) 
provides more functionality than this.

Unlike the maven plugin, which is installed by maven automatically,
the according ant plugin must be installed manually.
One way is to download the jar file

latex-maven-plugin-1.5.SNAPSHOT-antTask.jar,

or whatever version from 

[www.simuline.eu/RepositoryMaven](https://www.simuline.eu/RepositoryMaven/eu/simuline/m2latex/latex-maven-plugin-1.5.SNAPSHOT)

or to download the sources from

[GitHub](https://github.com/Reissner/maven-latex-plugin),

build with maven which creates the abovementioned jar file in the target folder.

In any case, the installation is just by copying that jar file
into the `lib` folder of the local ant installation.
For details see ant's documentation. 

## To-dos <a id='ss:todo'></a>

This section is just an unsorted collection of to-dos and needs rework. 
This is itself a to-do. 

- The code contains a lot of `FIXME` tags waiting to be resolved. 
- Evaluation of 
  - alternatives of `bibtex` 
    like `bibtexu`, `bibtex8`, `biber`, `biblatex` required 

  - alternatives of `makeindex` like `xindy` required 
  
  - make-tools like `latexmk`, `arara`, `rubber` and `cluttex` required 

- I would like to continue to support `dvi`-format. 
  But I must research how to create that one. 
  
- Translation of latex to `html` and to `docx` required

- document the role of `mathjax`

- The newest version of gnuplot introduce the problem 
  that the `pdf` output version is 1.7 whereas the one for `pdflatex` is 1.5. 
  This yields a warning. 
  A way to resolve that problem is just downgrading by subsequent invocation
  of something like 

```bsh
  gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4  -o output.pdf input.pdf 
```

- Bug-fix: `pandoc` missing end aligned at the beginning of manual. 
- Bug-fix: `pandoc` seems to fail with floating objects 
- evaluation of `pandoc`. 
  There is a manual. 
  First shot: got a good result with 

```bash
pandoc -t html -s --toc manualLatexMavenPlugin.tex -o manual.html
pandoc -t odt  -s --toc manualLatexMavenPlugin.tex -o manual.odt
```

One could also try with `--mathml`, `--mathjax` and with `--webtex` 
which works well... somehow. 
See the `pandoc` manual for further ideas including `gladtex`
  Here, `-t` or `--target` indicates the target format. 
  The list of available formats: 

```bash
pandoc --list-output-formats
```

shows 

- `rtf` which may make `latex2rtf` superfluous, 
- `docx`, `odt`, maybe making `unoconv` superfluous, 
- `html`, `html4`, `html5` maybe substituting tex4ht 
- `plain`, maybe text, then substituting 
- `pdf` (maybe using `pdflatex`)
  
Pandoc shall be invoked with option `--verbose` 
which seem to indicate the most important flaws. 
  
- Support for `ps` is missing. 

- `pdfinfo` and other `poppler` tools to be evaluated. 

- Evaluation of `unoconv`: seems to offer also conversion from `html` to `odt` and
  that like. 
  Very bad: no manual. I hate that. 
  Maybe not needed if `pandoc` works fine. 
  Just type `unoconv -f odt manual.html`. 

- Evaluation of latex2png, latex2man, latex2nemeth, latex2html

- evaluation of `pstoedit`

- It seems reasonable, to write a new plugin based on `texinfo`. 

## To the (plugin) developer <a id='ss:devel'></a>

`VS code` shows: 
There are lots of `FIXME`'s and `TODO`'s to be eliminated. 

In addition, there is some problem running `mvn deploy` 
showing `An illegal reflective access operation` 
which is currently just a warning 
but which may in some next release be a showstopper.
The core problem is with `mockito-core` which I cannot update. 
The problem is that updating this requires update of java `1.8` to java `11`. 
This in turn seems not compatible with `maven-plugin-plugin`. 
The latter seems to be the core problem. 

In addition, there is a strange problem with clean plugin. 
Although it says that it deletes the requested files (`mvn clean -X`), 
it does not. 

Finally, there are various problems with the plugin test harness. 

A completely different problem is introduced 
by the fact, that with new test method based on diffing real `pdf`'s, 
the tests become sensitive on the versions of `pdflatex`. 
In particular, if the version of `pdflatex` changes, 
the `pdf` files used for comparison must be changed also. 
To that end, run a script copying the current `pdf`s overwriting the blueprints 
from the base directory (this presupposes development in Linux):

```[sh]
src/main/resources/cpDiffPdf.sh
```
